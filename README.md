# MeanMedianMode:
This is a simple implementation of the concept of Mean, Median and Mode using Arrays to store the elements. 'Mean' is the average of all the elements given as an input. 'Median' is the middle value in the list of sorted elements. In case of Odd Number of elements, the middle number is displayed while in case of Even Number of elements two elements in the middle are displayed along with their average. 'Mode' denotes the element which occurs the most among the inputted elements.  Note that Multimodal Elements are not supported and in case of lack of any mode, the smallest element in the array is displayed.
