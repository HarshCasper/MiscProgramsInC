# MiscProgramsInC
This repository consists of some miscellaneous topics and programs coded in C Programming Language.

1. MeanMedianMode:
This is a simple implementation of the concept of Mean, Median and Mode using Arrays to store the elements. 'Mean' is the average of all the elements given as an input. 'Median' is the middle value in the list of sorted elements. In case of Odd Number of elements, the middle number is displayed while in case of Even Number of elements two elements in the middle are displayed along with their average. 'Mode' denotes the element which occurs the most among the inputted elements.  Note that Multimodal Elements are not supported and in case of lack of any mode, the smallest element in the array is displayed.

2. Power:

This program calculates the Power of the Number with a complexity of O(log n). It implements a Recurssive Function which divides
the power by 2 each time it is called and if the power is even then a product of the value retrieved through Recursive Function is returned and if Odd then a prooduct of the value retrieved through Recursive Function along with the number itself is returned. For example if the number is 7 and power is 6: Then 6 will be divided by 2 and will be passed to the same function with the number being 6 and root being 3.
