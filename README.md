# MiscProgramsInC
This repository consists of some miscellaneous topics and programs coded in C Programming Language.

- MeanMedianMode:

This is a simple implementation of the concept of Mean, Median and Mode using Arrays to store the elements. 'Mean' is the average of all the elements given as an input. 'Median' is the middle value in the list of sorted elements. In case of Odd Number of elements, the middle number is displayed while in case of Even Number of elements two elements in the middle are displayed along with their average. 'Mode' denotes the element which occurs the most among the inputted elements.  Note that Multimodal Elements are not supported and in case of lack of any mode, the smallest element in the array is displayed. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/MeanMedianMode.c).

- Power:

This program calculates the Power of the Number with a complexity of O(log n). It implements a Recurssive Function which divides
the power by 2 each time it is called and if the power is even then a product of the value retrieved through Recursive Function is returned and if Odd then a prooduct of the value retrieved through Recursive Function along with the number itself is returned. For example if the number is 7 and power is 6: Then 6 will be divided by 2 and will be passed to the same function with the number being 6 and root being 3. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/Power.c).

- Menu :

This is the solution to a problem given [here](https://github.com/jorgegonzalez/beginner-projects#menu-calculator) the user enters a numeric code based upon the things he is buying and the bill is returned to him. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/Menu.c).

- RockPapersScissors :

This is the implementation of the ridiculously popular Rock, Papers and Scissors Game in C Programming Language where the player plays against a computer. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/RockPaperScissors.c).

- GuessGame :

This is a C implementation of High Lower Guessing Game where the Computer puts a number and the user needs to guess it. If the
user guesses a greater number than what computer has put up, a message is displayed that User has entered a greater number and vice
versa. In addition, Lifeline Options have also been added to the game to allow the user some hints like whether the number is Even/Odd,
Prime/Composite or the sum of digits. A Guess counter has also been added for further compatability. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/GuessGame.c).

- PasswordStrenth : 

The is an implementation of Password Strenth Measurer in C Programming Language. This basic Strenth Checker, checks
the length of the Password Strenth, the presence of Uppercase Character, Lowercase Character, Digits and finally the Special Characters
and if all the criteria are met, then the password strenth is strong otherwise medium or weak. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/PasswordStrength.c).

- Stack :

The following program is the implementation of the Stack Data Structure using Arrays on C-Programming Languages with basic operations
like Push, Pop, Display and Peek performed on the Stack. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/Stack.c).

- LinkedList :

This program is an implementation of Linked List in C Programming Language with Insertion and Display Operations performed on them. Solution can be found here [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/LinkedList.c).

- Anagram:  

The following program is an implementation of the popular Anangram problem wherein if two words are formed off the same set of
characters, they can be called as anagrams. Example of anagrams are 'tab' and 'bat' which are formed off the same set of characters
{a,b,t}. Hence here is an implementation of the Anagrams problem which calculates the sum of value of ASCII characters to check if
two words are Anangram or not. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/Anagram.c).

- Insertion Sort 

This program implements Insertion Sort in C-Programming Language. Insertion Sort is a popular Sorting Algorithm which sorts an array in O(n^2) Time Complexity following an Incremental Approach Programming Paradigm. It works by comparing a particular element with the rest elements in the array and then shifts the element if an element is found greater.  Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/insertion-sort.c).

- Bubble Sort 

Bubble Sort is one of the most commonly used Sorting Algorithm and is best preffered for Arrays/Lists with less number of elements. It works by checking each and every adjacent element in the list/array and if the previous element is greater than the latter one then a Swap Operation is performed to place the element in its correct position with respect to the particular element. The total number of passes done are (Number of Elements-1) within which the whole of the array will be sorted out. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Sorting/blob/master/bubble-sort.c).

- Quick Sort 

Quick Sort is one of the most popular Sorting Algorithms out there in the field of Programming designed and implemented here in the C Programming Language demonstrating a Time Complexity of O(nlog(n)) in its Best Case while O(n^2) in it's worst case making it significantly faster than many popular Sorting Algorithms. It follows the "Divide and Conquer" paradigm where it divides the array into two equal halves as it is easier to sort them, with a Pivot element near the middle of array allowing to elements to move to their apt position. The primary disadvantage of such an array is the use of Recursion which leads to High Stack Consumption. Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/Sorting/blob/master/quick-sort.c).

Diwali is a classic rendition of the Diwali Lamp using Pattern Programming which can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/diwali.c)

- Cracker

Cracker is the classic rendition of the Diwali using Pattern Programming which can be found [here](https://github.com/HarshCasper/MiscProgramsInC/blob/master/cracker.c)
